# Machine Learning

- **machine learning**: ability of computers to learn and make decisions from data w/o being explicitly programmed

- **unsupervised learning**: uses unlabeled data
    - **clustering**: group data into categories, where categories not known beforehand
    - **reinforcement learning**: software agent acts within environment, actions are rewarded or punished, agent uses these responses to optimize behavior

- **supervised learning**: uses labeled data
    - has **predictor variables/features/independent variables** and a **target/response/dependent variable**
    - **labeled data** has known output i.e. target variable value is known
    - goal is to build a model that can predict target variable given predictor variables
        - to automate time consuming or expensive manual task
        - to make predictions about the future
    - if target variable is continuous, it's a **regression task**
    - if target variable is discrete, it's a **classification task**
        - binary decisions have discrete set of values i.e. true or false
